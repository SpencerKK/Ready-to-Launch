      <p>
        I started Ready to Launch Podcasts knowing from the bottom of my heart
        that I could help to bridge the gap for current and future podcasters,
        getting them from where they were to where they wanted to be. Over the
        years I have been approached by countless people who were struggling
        to find the confidence and/or direction necessary to bring their
        unique and precious podcasting goals to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        One by one, as I helped to envision, launch and grow these people’s
        shows I realized my own unique role in the alchemization of these
        people’s visions to reality, and there was no turning back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone has their own set of skills, passions and gifts—which is what
        makes life so interesting! Podcasting is simply a way to broadcast
        this. Whether you are a guest on a show, the podcaster, or the person
        behind the scenes building the network for all of it to happen, we all
        immensely benefit from this amazing medium.
      </p>
      <p>
        As my own unique set of gifts and interests became clearer to me, I
        realized it was time to start Ready to Launch Podcasts. I work through
        Ready to Launch Podcasts to provide a powerful network of dedicated
        podcasters and quality guests, to help successfully launch the
        podcasts of the future, and to offer the guidance and support that
        ultimately make all the difference both in the outcome of the show and
        the experience of the creator. The opportunity to work with people
        through Ready to Launch Podcasts is the essence of all my passions
        coming together. Collaboration, creation, vulnerability and making as
        many people's visions as possible into an everyday reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can’t wait to speak with you to see what we have in store! Xx
