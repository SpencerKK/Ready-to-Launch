          The emergence of strong female voices in recent years has propelled
          the podcasting industry into a new era. Where it used to be
          exceptionally male dominated, the number of shows produced, hosted and
          consumed by young women is growing every day. Thankfully, this
          transformation is bringing light to topics and points of view that
          would have otherwise remained in the shadows. It has also provided
          tremendous career and growth opportunities for the young women
          involved and will continue to do so for those who succeed.

        <p>
          Still, as podcasting is new,
          <b
            >there remains a gap in the industry where there could be community,
            support and collaboration.</b
          >
          This is limiting for those that decide to pursue podcasting, but
          ultimately give up because of the difficulties they face in the
          process of launching and growing their shows.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ready to Launch Podcasts network is the first podcasting network
          for up-and-coming female podcasters who have shown promise in their
          mission and ability to communicate their message.
          <b
