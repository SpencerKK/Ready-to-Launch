        Once you’ve launched your podcast, it’s time to grow your show.
        There’s so much more that goes into telling your story than the tips
        and tricks you read about online. We will work closely together to
        keep your podcast on the right track through consultations wherein we
        discuss marketing strategy, niche development, future guests,
        potential sponsorship opportunities and more.

      <div class="question">
        <h1>Why start a podcast?</h1>
        <p>
          Honey, where do I start? At the end of the day, everyone has their
          own personal reason for launching a podcast. What applies to
          everyone is the future of the podcast industry. Where an estimated
          only 20% of Americans knew what a podcast was in 2006, today that
          number is 70%. I interviewed the founder of the Forbes Podcast on my
          own show, The Ready to Launch Podcast, who said anyone that starts a
          podcast today and sticks with it will benefit enormously in a few
          years from now when podcasting consumption and production is
          exponentially more popular. If you have a reason for wanting to
          start your show, but are unsure of whether the timing is right, THE
          TIME IS RIGHT.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h1>Can I make money from podcasting?</h1>
        <p>
          YES! In the past five years, ad revenue from podcasting has
          increased 1000%. In 2019, podcast ad revenue was an estimated $514
          million, an estimated $659 million in 2020, and in 2021, ad revenue
          is expected to surpass $1 billion. You do not need a massive
          audience to find sponsors that are excited to work with you. You
          need a dedicated, niche audience that trusts your word and that you
          can build a relationship with. Podcasts with only a few hundred
          downloads per episode can still make thousands of dollars per
          episode if they establish their niche correctly and build a
          relationship with an enthusiastic and satisfied sponsor. We will
          work toward this together!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h1>How do I create relationships with high-quality guests?</h1>
        <p>
          Booking guests is one of the most exciting parts of podcasting
          because if you are confident in your approach, you have the ability
          to build relationships with some of your greatest role models.
          Still, to a lot of people, this aspect of podcasting can be
          intimidating and seem more like a time commitment and a chore with
          little return. Together, we will establish a method for reaching out
          to your dream guests that you can be proud of. Through my own
          podcast, I have had the chance to speak to people I never would have
          dreamed of speaking to and it all comes down to your ability to
          communicate your podcast’s legitimacy and your authentic desire to
          speak with them.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-2">
      <div class="question">
        <h1>How much of a time commitment is podcasting?</h1>
        <p>
          Time does not equal return. Once we establish your podcasting goals
          and approach to launch and growth, you should not feel overwhelmed
          with the amount of time your podcast is requiring of you. A huge
          part of this is because when you podcast with Ready to Launch
          Podcasts it is no longer a one-man show. You have the guidance, the
          feedback, and the Ready to Launch Podcasts network available to you.
          A lack of collaboration is what holds so many podcasts back and ends
          up costing podcasters so much time. Our consultations will as well
          accelerate your learning curve and encourage the consistent
          development of your show.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h1>Do I need to buy equipment?</h1>
        <p>
          This is up to you, but if you are in podcasting for the long haul, I
          highly recommend you do. Yes, our phones provide pretty good
          microphones, but you can always tell the difference when a podcaster
          records with a proper microphone vs. when they record with their
          phone. I still use the same microphone I bought when I first started
          out, and it has been one of my greatest investments. When I first
          started The Ready to Launch Podcast, my friends all told me they
          expected it to have low-quality audio (thanks!) but were so
          pleasantly surprised that it sounded so clear and crisp. Not only
          did this make me take pride in my work, but when guests are deciding
          whether they want to come on your show or not, oftentimes it depends
          on the quality of your production. My microphone cost me around $100
          and is one of the best on the market!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="question">
        <h1>Why work with Ready to Launch Podcasts?</h1>
        <p>
          You need to choose where you are going to invest in your show—while
          it’s true that there are an estimated 750,000 launched podcasts, a
          staggering number of those go out of production by episode #7. This
          phenomenon has been coined the notorious Podfade and often this can
          be seen on platforms like Anchor. I believe this is because
          podcasting is still new; there is still an inherent lack of
          community between podcasts, a lack of knowledge around how to have a
          successful launch, and as time goes on with little return, people
          forget their WHY instead of honing in on their niche. I get that it
          could be isolating and discouraging, and this could lead people to
          only publish a few episodes, but this doesn’t have to be the case!
          It is important to me that any podcaster working with Ready to
          Launch Podcasts actually experiences podcasting how it should be
          experienced: with a return on investment, a growing network of other
          podcasters to cross-collaborate with, with quality guests that they
          can be enthusiastic to speak to, the confidence in their ability to
          land a dream sponsor that aligns with the vision of their show and,
          most importantly, to actually feel liberated throughout this process
          and to take pride in their show. THAT IS HOW IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE!
          Start podcasting with Ready to Launch Podcasts knowing that you’re
          doing so strategically and that you’re a part of a network that
          reflects the caliber of your show.
