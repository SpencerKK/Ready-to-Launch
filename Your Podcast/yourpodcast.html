          The biggest thing holding podcasts back from becoming successful
          podcasts is the fact that <b>most of them never get made.</b> Over the
          years, countless people have approached me with truly great ideas for
          podcasts they want to start — but none of those ideas are ever made
          into shows. The reasons for this included a fear of public failure,
          the lack of spare time, or even believing they had “nothing unique or
          valuable to offer.”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <b>
            It’s time to step out of your own way! Your community is waiting for
            you.
          </b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          So often, we are our own greatest obstacles. I get it —
          <b>
            but the most important step to take is the one right in front of
            you.
          </b>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We will work together and offer you the
          <b>
            proper tools, guidance, support, and network that will ensure a
            successful launch of your show that you can be proud of</b
