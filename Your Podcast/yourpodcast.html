      <p>
        The biggest thing holding podcasts back from becoming successful
        podcasts is the fact that <b>most of them never get made.</b> Over the
        years, countless people have approached me with truly great ideas for
        podcasts they want to start — but none of those ideas are ever made
        into shows. The reasons for this included a fear of public failure,
        the lack of spare time, or even believing they had “nothing unique or
        valuable to offer.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>
          It’s time to step out of your own way! Your community is waiting for
          you.
        </b>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        So often, we are our own greatest obstacles. I get it —
        <b>
          but the most important step to take is the one right in front of
          you.
        </b>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We will work together and offer you the
        <b>
          proper tools, guidance, support, and network that will ensure a
          successful launch of your show that you can be proud of</b>
